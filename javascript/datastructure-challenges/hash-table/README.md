# Implementation: Hash Tables

## Features
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

## set
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
## get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
## contains
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
keys
Returns: Collection of keys
## hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Code Challenge
Find the first repeated word in a book.

### Feature Tasks
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
Arguments: string
Return: string

## Code Challenge
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

### Feature Tasks
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.
