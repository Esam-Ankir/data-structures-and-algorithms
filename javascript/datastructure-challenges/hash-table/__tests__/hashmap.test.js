// Setting a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
// Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
// Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
// Successfully returns a list of all unique keys that exist in the hashtable
// Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
// Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
// Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

// For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at minimum:

// “Happy Path” - Expected outcome
// Expected failure
// Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
// Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
